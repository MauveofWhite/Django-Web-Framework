App Packaging
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/reusable-apps/

1. Create parent directory 'parent'

2. Move app to parent directory 'parent'

3. Create 'parent/README.rst'

4. Create 'parent/LICENSE'. Default BSD-3-Clause

5. Create 'parent/setup.cfg' and 'parent/setup.py'

6. Create 'parent/MANIFEST.in'

7. Create 'parent/docs' that put addition documentation and
  add 'recursive-include docs *' in MANIFEST.in

8. In 'parent', run python setup.py sdist

Using your own package

1. To install the package, use pip.
python -m pip install --user django-polls/dist/django-polls-0.1.tar.gz

2. Run the server again to confirm this.

3. To uninstall the package, use pip:
python -m pip uninstall django-polls

Installing Python packages with a virtual environment
Earlier, we installed the polls app as a user library. This has some disadvantages:
- Modifying the user libraries can affect other Python software on your system.
- You won’t be able to run multiple versions of this package (or others with the same name).

Typically, these situations only arise once you’re maintaining several Django projects. When they do, the best solution is to use venv*. This tool allows you to maintain multiple isolated Python environments, each with its own copy of the libraries and package namespace.
